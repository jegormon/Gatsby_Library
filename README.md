# Gatsby Library website

[Live demo](https://gatsby-library.netlify.app)

## Overview

This website was built using Gatsby JS and allows users to search for book titles using the open library API. Users can also brows details for a few selected books from a couple of authors. That data is partly hardcoded in JSON files. Those are linked together using GraphQL. The book covers are pulled live from the open library API.

## Features

- Book title search
- View details for select books from authors
- Book covers pulled live from open library API

## Data Sources

I obtained the book data for this website from two sources:

Custom data in JSON format files for select books from authors
